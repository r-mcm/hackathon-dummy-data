**Heart Rate** - 60-100bpm

**Blood Pressure** - Systolic pressure (90-120mmHg) Diastolic (60-80mmHg) shown as Systolic/Diastolic (90/60mmHg or 90 over 60)

**Body temp** - 36.1-37.2 C

**Respiration** - 12-16 breaths per minute

**Oxygen saturation** - % normally 95 or higher, warning below 90


## System Data

The below is a description of each of the values that have been generated as example data from the systems on a life support wheelchair, these are averages to be used as a guide and is not an exhaustive list:

**Ventilator** - between 60 and 120 L/min.

**Waste Processing system #1** - via catheter 60-90mls per hour, 1500mls over a 24 hour period. Warning if none over a 2-3 hour period and or less than 400mls over a 24 hour period.

**Waste Processing system #2** - via catheter 10-100ml per minute, not included but may also consider monitoring weight of the waste bags.

**Power System** - % of battery power remaining, shown as discharging in approx. 16 hours and charging in 100 minutes. Not included but may also consider monitoring of voltage and amperage.
